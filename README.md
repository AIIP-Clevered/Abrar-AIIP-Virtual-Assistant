# Virtual Assistant

Using snap, I have created a virtual assistant app where you can ask questions to the assistant to which it will give answers accordingly. There are 3 topics about which you can ask questions to the virtual assistant. Each category consists of 6 questions. As for the main menu, I have just used a picture of an Alexa device. This project is helpful in many cases for example, if a person is curious about a topic they can clear their doubts by asking their questions to the virtual assistant.
